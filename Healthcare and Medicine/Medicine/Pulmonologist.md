A pulmonologist is a specialized medical professional who focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases related to the respiratory system. They specialize in treating conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. Pulmonologists perform various diagnostic tests, including lung function tests, bronchoscopy, and thoracentesis, to evaluate and diagnose respiratory disorders. They provide medical interventions such as prescribing medications, administering breathing treatments, and performing interventional procedures like bronchoscopies or biopsies. Pulmonologists often work closely with other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care to patients and help them manage their respiratory health effectively. Their expertise plays a vital role in preventing, diagnosing, and treating respiratory diseases to improve patients' quality of life.
