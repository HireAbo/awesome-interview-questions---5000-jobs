Library and Information Science is a field that focuses on the organization, management, and dissemination of information resources within libraries and other information centers. It encompasses various areas, including cataloging, reference services, collection development, digital libraries, and information technology.

Librarians are responsible for tasks such as assisting patrons in finding information, managing library collections, designing and implementing programs and services, and promoting literacy and lifelong learning.
