It plays a crucial role in providing food security, improving rural livelihoods, and supporting economic growth. Environmental science, on the other hand, focuses on understanding the interactions between humans and the environment. It examines the impact of human activities on natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity, and seeks to develop sustainable solutions. Within the field of agriculture, one fascinating job is that of a florist.
