A rancher is a professional who specializes in managing and operating a ranch, which is a large piece of land dedicated to raising livestock, such as cattle, sheep, or horses. As an integral part of the agriculture industry, ranchers play a crucial role in ensuring the sustainable production of meat, dairy, and other animal products. They are responsible for various tasks, including breeding, feeding, and caring for the animals, as well as maintaining the ranch facilities and equipment.
