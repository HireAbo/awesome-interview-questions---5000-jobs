# Glider Pilot Interview Prep

Welcome to the Glider Pilot Interview Preparation ! This resource is designed to help you ace your Glider Pilot interviews with confidence.

A glider pilot is an aviation professional specializing in flying glider aircraft, which are unpowered aircraft designed to fly without the use of an engine. Glider pilots rely on natural forces such as thermals, ridge lift, and wave lift to stay aloft and maneuver. This unique and exhilarating form of aviation requires a strong understanding of aerodynamics, meteorology, and navigation. Glider pilots are skilled in launching and landing techniques, as well as maintaining control and stability during flight. They often participate in competitions, recreational flights, and even perform aerobatic maneuvers. Glider pilots possess a sense of adventure, excellent decision-making skills, and a deep passion for the art of flying.
