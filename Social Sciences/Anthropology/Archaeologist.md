An archaeologist is a professional who studies human history and culture through the excavation and analysis of artifacts and remains. As a subfield of anthropology, archaeologists use scientific methods to uncover ancient civilizations, their lifestyles, and their development over time. Their work involves conducting surveys to identify potential excavation sites, carefully excavating artifacts and structures, and meticulously documenting findings. Archaeologists analyze these discoveries to gain insights into past human behavior, social organizations, and technological advancements. They also collaborate with other experts, such as historians and geologists, to interpret and contextualize their findings.
