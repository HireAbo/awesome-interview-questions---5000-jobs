This branch of social sciences combines scientific techniques with anthropological theories to aid in criminal investigations, mass disasters, or human rights violation cases. Forensic anthropologists use their expertise to determine age, sex, ancestry, and stature of the deceased, as well as identifying any trauma or cause of death. They may also assist in the creation of facial reconstructions or contribute to the development of databases for missing persons. Their work plays a crucial role in providing answers and justice to families and communities affected by such events.
