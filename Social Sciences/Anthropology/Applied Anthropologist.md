Applied anthropology is a subfield of anthropology that focuses on the practical application of anthropological theories and methods to address contemporary social issues. Applied anthropologists utilize their understanding of human behavior, culture, and society to develop strategies and interventions that promote positive social change. In the context of social sciences, they work closely with communities, organizations, and policymakers to tackle complex problems such as poverty, healthcare disparities, environmental conservation, and community development. By conducting research, conducting interviews, and engaging in participatory approaches, applied anthropologists provide valuable insights and solutions that are culturally sensitive and contextually relevant, ultimately contributing to the betterment of society.
