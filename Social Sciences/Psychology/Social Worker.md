As part of the field of social sciences, specifically psychology, social workers focus on applying psychological principles and theories to help individuals overcome challenges and improve their overall mental health. They assist people in accessing necessary resources, such as healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities. Social workers often work directly with vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and those experiencing mental health issues or substance abuse problems.
