Social workers and human service professionals work to address social issues and provide support to vulnerable populations, aiming to enhance their quality of life. They engage in counseling, advocacy, and resource coordination to assist individuals and families in overcoming various challenges. On the other hand, public health professionals focus on preventing diseases, promoting healthy lifestyles, and improving healthcare systems. Within the realm of public health, nutritionists play a crucial role in educating individuals about healthy eating habits, designing personalized diet plans, and promoting a balanced approach to nutrition for optimal health.
