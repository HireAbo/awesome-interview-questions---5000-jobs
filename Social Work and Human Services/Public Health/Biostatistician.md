Social work and human services are vital fields that focus on improving the well-being and quality of life for individuals, families, and communities. Professionals in these fields provide support and assistance to individuals facing various challenges such as poverty, mental health issues, addiction, and domestic violence. They play a crucial role in advocating for social justice and equality, and often work closely with other professionals in healthcare, education, and government agencies.

On the other hand, public health is a multidisciplinary field that aims to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private communities, and individuals. Public health professionals work on a wide range of issues, including disease prevention, health promotion, policy development, and community engagement.

In the realm of public health, biostatisticians play a crucial role in designing and analyzing health-related studies to generate valid and reliable evidence. They use statistical methods to interpret data, identify patterns and trends, and make informed decisions about public health interventions and policies. By employing their expertise in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, biostatisticians contribute to improving health outcomes and informing public health practice.
