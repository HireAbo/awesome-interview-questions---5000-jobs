A veterinary dermatologist is a specialized veterinarian who focuses on diagnosing and treating skin, hair, and ear conditions in animals.

A veterinary dermatologist utilizes advanced diagnostic techniques such as skin biopsies, allergy testing, and microscopic examination to determine the underlying cause of dermatological issues.
