# Holistic Veterinarian Interview Prep

Welcome to the Holistic Veterinarian Interview Preparation ! This resource is designed to help you ace your Holistic Veterinarian interviews with confidence.

Veterinary medicine is a branch of healthcare that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and injuries in animals. It encompasses various specialized fields, including holistic veterinary medicine. Holistic veterinarians take a holistic approach to animal care, considering the overall well-being of the animal, including physical, mental, and emotional aspects. They integrate conventional veterinary medicine with complementary and alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, chiropractic care, and nutritional counseling. Holistic veterinarians aim to treat the underlying cause of an animal's health issues, rather than just addressing the symptoms. This approach promotes a balanced and natural approach to animal healthcare, ensuring the overall well-being of the animal.
